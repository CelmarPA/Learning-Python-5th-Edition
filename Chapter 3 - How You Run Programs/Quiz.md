    In whatever console that your platform provides: a Command Prompt on Windows; a xterm or terminal window on Unix, Linux, and Mac OS X; and so on.

3. **Name four or more ways to run the code saved in a script file.**
    It can be run with system command lines, file icon cliks, import and reload, the exec built-in function, and IDE GUI selections.

4. **Name two pitfalls related to clicking file icons on Windows.**

5. **Why might you need to reload a module?**

6. **How do you run a script from within IDLE?**
    Select the window's Run â†’ Run Module menu option.

7. **Name two pitfalls related to using IDLE.**

8. **What is a namespace, and how does it relate to module files?**
    A namespace is just a package of variables, takes the form of an object with attributes  in Python, each module file is automatically a namespace, that is, a package of variables reflecting the assignments made at the top level of the file. It helps to avoid name collisions in Python programs, because each module is a self-contained namespace.
