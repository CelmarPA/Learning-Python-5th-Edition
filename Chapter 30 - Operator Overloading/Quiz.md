# Quiz Chapter 30

1. **What two operator overloading methods can you use to support iteration in your classes?**
    Classes can support iteration by defining (or inheriting) `__getitem__` or `__iter__`. In all iteration contexts, Python tries to use `__iter__` first, which returns an object that supports the iteration protocol with a `__next__` method: if no `__iter__` is found by inheritance search, Python falls back on the `__getitem__` indexing method, which is called repeatedly, with successively higher indexes. If used, the `yield` statement can create the `__next__` method automatically.

2. **What two operator overloading methods handle printing, and in what contexts?**
    The `__str__` and `__repr__` methods implement object print displays. The former is called by the `print`and `str` built-in functions; the latter is called by `print` and `str` if there is no `__str__`, and always by the `repr`built-in, interactive echoes, and nested appearances. That is, `__repr__` is used everywhere, except by `print` and `str` when a `__str__` is defined. A `__str__` is usually used for user-friendly displays; `__repr__` gives extra details or the object's as-code form.

3. **How can you intercept slice operations in a class?**
    Slicing is caught by the `__getitem__` indexing method: it is called with a slice object, instead of a simple integer index, and slice objects may be passed on or inspected as needed.

4. **How can you catch in-place addition in a class?**
    In-place addiction tries `__iadd__` first, and `__add__` with an assignment second. The same pattern holds true for all binary operators. The `__radd__` method is also available for right-side addition.

5. **When should you provide operator overloading?**
    When a class naturally matches, or needs to emulate, a built-in type's interfaces. For example, collections might imitate sequence or mapping interfaces, and callables might be coded for use with an API that expects a function. You generally shouldn't implement expression operators if they don't naturally map to your objects naturally and logically, thoughâ€”use normally name methods instead.
