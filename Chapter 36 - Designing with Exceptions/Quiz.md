# Quiz Chapter 36

1. **(This question is a repeat from the first quiz in Chapter 1—see, I told you it would be easy! :-) Why does “spam” 
    show up in so many Python examples in books and on the Web?**
    Because Python is named after the British comedy group Monty Python (based on
    surveys I’ve conducted in classes, this is a much-too-well-kept secret in the Python
    world!). The spam reference comes from a Monty Python skit, set in a cafeteria
    whose menu items all seem to come with Spam. A couple trying to order food there
    keeps getting drowned out by a chorus of Vikings singing a song about Spam.
