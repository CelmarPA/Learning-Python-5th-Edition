# Quiz Chapter 04

1. **Name four of Python’s core data types.**
    Numbers, lists, sets, dictionaries, tuple, strings, file.

2. **Why are they called “core” data types?**
    Because they are part of the Python language itself and are always available.

3. **What does “immutable” mean, and which three of Python’s core types are considered immutable?**
    That cannot be changed after its created. Numbers, strings and tuples are immutable in Python.

4. **What does “sequence” mean, and which three types fall into that category?**
    A "sequence" is a positionally ordered collection of objects. Python types strings, lists and tuples fall into this category.

5. **What does “mapping” mean, and which core type is a mapping?**
    The "mapping" term denotes an object that map key to associated values. Python's dictionary is the only mapping type in the core type set.

6. **What is “polymorphism,” and why should you care?**
    Polymorphism means that the meaning of an operation depends on the object being operated on. This is the key idea behind using Python well, not constraining code to specific types makes that code automatically applicable to many types.
