X = 'spam'
Y = 'eggs'
X, Y = Y, X

# Python unpacks this tuple and assigns the first value ('eggs') to X and the second value ('spam') to Y.

# In Python, the expression X, Y = Y, X creates a temporary tuple to hold the values being swapped. This ensures that the original values of X and Y are preserved during the assignment.
