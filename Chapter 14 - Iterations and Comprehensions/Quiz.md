# Quiz Chapter 13

1. **What are the main functional differences between a `while` and a `for`?**
    The `while` loop is a general looping statement, but the `for` is designed to iterate across items in a sequence or other iterable.

2. **What’s the difference between `break` and `continue`?**
    The `break` statement exits a loop immediately (you wind up below the entire `while` or `for` loop statement),  and `continue` jumps back to the top of the loop.

3. **When is a loop’s `else` clause executed?**
    The `else` clause in a `while` or `for`loop will be run once as the loop exiting, id the loop exits normally (without running into a break statement).

4. **How can you code a counter-based loop in Python?**
    Counter loops can be coded with a `while`statement that keeps track of the index manually, or with a `for` loop that uses the `range` built-in function to generate successive integer offsets.

5. **What can a `range` be used for in a `for` loop?**
    The `range` built-in can be used in a `for` loop to implement a fixed number od repetitions, to scan by offsets instead of items at offsets, to skip successive items as you go, and to change a list while stepping across it.
