# Quiz Chapter 34

1. **What is the try statement for?**
    The `try` statement catches and recovers from exceptionsâ€”it specifies a block of code to run, and one or more handlers for exceptions that may be raised during the block's execution.

2. **What are the two common variations of the try statement?**
    The two common variations on the `try` statement are `try/except/else` (for catching exceptions) and `try/finally` (for specifying cleanup actions that must occur whether an exception is raised or not).

3. **What is the raise statement for?**
    The `raise` statement raises (triggers) an exception. Python triggers built-in exceptions on errors internally, but your scripts can trigger built-in or user-defined exceptions with `raise`, too.

4. **What is the assert statement designed to do, and what other statement is it like?**
    The `assert` statement raises an `AssertionError` exception if a condition is false. It works like a conditional `raise` statement wrapped up in an `if` statement, and can be disabled with a `-O` switch.

5. **What is the with/as statement designed to do, and what other statement is it like?**
    The `with/as` statement is designed to automate startup and termination activities that must occur around a block of code. It is roughly like a `try/finally` statement in that its exit actions run whether an exception occurred or not, but it allows a richer object-based protocol for specifying entry and exit actions, and may reduce code size.
